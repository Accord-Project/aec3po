## Description

The AEC3PO RASE Statement module describes how statements may be decomposed using the Requirement, Application, Selection, Exception methodology.

The fundamental assumption of RASE is that it operates on all "things" in a building. (Term these objects)

For a "thing" to pass any given regulations it must either:

- Meet the requirement
- Be not applicable
- Be not selected
- Be excepted

The figure below illustrates the core concepts of the RASE Statement module
