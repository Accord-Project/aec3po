<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The AEC3PO Evidence module describes all resources that can be used to assess the validity and relevance of the statement. <p>

<p>Document subdivisions can be described as literals, link to their first part, and to their immediate following subdivision. This enables roundtripping from a document to its AEC3PO description, and back.</p>
