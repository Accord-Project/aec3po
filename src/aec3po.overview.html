## Overview of AEC3PO modules and alignments <a name="Overview"></a>

### AEC3PO Modules <a name="modules"></a> 
AEC3PO aims to model all aspects of compliance and permitting on the AEC domain, across different regulatory systems.
It is organised into modules, comprising of classes and properties. The figure below shows an overview of these modules and their relations

</figure>

Below is an overview of the core modules and their components:
<ol>
 <li>**Module 1: Document**: A document, of any kind, typically related to compliance and permitting. </li>
    <ul>
    <li>**Classes:** _Document_, _DocumentSubdivision_.</li>
    <li>**Properties:** _hasPart_, _hasRequiredData_, _forDocument_, _hasPermittingStage_, _etc_. </li>
    </ul>

<li>**Module 2: Statement**: A statement, of any kind, found in a document. </li>
    <ul>
      <li>**Classes:** _Statement_, _DefinitionStatement_, _CheckStatement_, _CheckListStatement_, _CategoryCheckStatement_, _CertificateCheckStatement_, _BooleanCheckStatement_, _NumericalCheckStatement_, _HumanEvaluatedCheckStatement_, _etc_. </li>
      <li>**Properties:** _hasSubdivision_, _hasRequiredData_, _hasEvidence_, _hasDefinition_, _definitionOf_, _etc_. </li>
    <\ul>  

3. **Module 3: DataRequirement**: The data requirements that derive from a statement. These can describe any aspect of the building model or any type of property, physical or conceptual, associated with it.
  -	Classes: _DataRequirement_, _IDS_.
  -	Properties: _hasFormat_, _etc_.

4. **Module 4: Evidence**: The evidence that an actor in the compliance and permitting process needs to provide in order to prove that the requirements derived from a Statement have been met.
      Evidence can be presented in a variety of forms, though typically they'll be in document form.
  -	Classes: _Evidence_.
  -	Properties: _hasFormat_, _forDocument_, _etc_.

5. **Module 5: CheckMethod**: Information that operationalizes Checks in documents.
  -	Classes: _CheckMethod_, _BooleanCheckMethod_, _ComponentCheckMethod_, _SHACLCheckMethod_, _ACCORDCheckMethod_, _FuncionCheckMethod_, etc.
  -	Properties: _hasUnit_, _hasTarget_, _operationalizes_, _operationalizedBy_,_etc_.
  
6. **Module 6: FeatureOfInterest**: A feature of a building that is of interest. Typically, this will be a building component that needs to be compliant to regulations, or be documented in the permitting process. 
      <!-- This module describes objects whose conformance against checks is verified, and those aspects of a feature of interest that are intrinsic to and cannot exist without the feature of interest, that must be checked for conformance. -->
  - Classes: _FeatureOfInterest_, _Property_, _PropertyKind_, _QuantityKind_
  -	Properties: _hasProperty_, _hasQuantityKind_, _hasPropertyKind_, _hasContext_, _etc_.
  
7. **Module 7: CheckingAct**
  - Classes: _CheckingAct_, _ProcessVerifier_, etc.
  - Properties: _usedMethod_, _madeBy_, _hasReport_, _checks_, _etc._

8. **Module 8: ComplianceVerificationReport**: An automatically generated report that checks if all the assigned compliance requirements (typically Checks) have been met.
  - Classes: _ComplianceVerificationReport_, _result_, _ValidationResult_,_Severity_, _etc_.
  - Properties: _conforms_, _focus_, _resultMessage_, _resultSeverity_, _Info_, _Violation_, _Severity_,_etc._
      
9. **Module 9: Legal Verifier**: This AEC3PO module defines state and private verifiers. 
    - Classes: _LegalVerifier_, _PrivateVerifier_, _StateVerifier_.
      
10. **Module 10: Model**: A model representing part or the entirety of a site, building, or piece of infrastructure.
  - Classes: _Model_, _Phase_, _Element_, _Classification_ etc.
  - Properties: _name_, _description_, _location_, _locationCoverage_, _material_, _hasBuildingPhase_, _hasDimension_, _hasElementPhase_, _hasClassification_, _etc._

11. **Module 11: Table**: This AEC3PO module describes tables as representations of data in rows and columns. Tables are described by captions.
    - Classes: _Container_, _Table_, _Column_, _Row_, _Cell_.
    - Properties: _contains_, _isContainedIn_, _caption_.  

13. **Module 13: RASEStatement**: This AEC3PO module describes statements decomposed following the Requirement Application Selection and Exception (RASE) methodology.
    - Classes:  _RequirementStatement_, _ApplicationStatement_, _SelectionStatement_, _ExceptionStatement_.
    - Properties: _requires_, _appliesTo_, _selects_, _except_. 
  

### AEC3PO Alignments <a name="alignments"></a>
AEC3PO contains five modules, which import an external ontology and specify alignment axioms to connect the terms. 
The figure below illustrates the alignment of AEC3PO with the imported ontologies.
AEC3PO is positioned in the centre, with the imported ontologies represented as separate nodes.

<!-- The figure above effectively conveys the interconnectedness of different ontologies with AEC3PO for a holistic understanding of compliance and permitting processes in the construction industry. This alignment facilitates cross-domain information sharing, enabling more accurate and comprehensive modeling of the complex construction ecosystem. The table below lists all the external ontologies, the namespaces and the suggested prefix for each ontology modules is also provided. -->

## Examples <a name="examples"></a>

The folder [`examples`](https://github.com/Accord-Project/aec3po/tree/main/examples) contains a collection of Turtle files that demonstrate the instantiation of the AEC3PO ontology in the context of the demo countries **_Finland_**, **_Estonia_**, **_Spain_** and **_UK_**. Each Turtle file within the folder represents a specific scenario where the ontology is instantiated to model compliance checking and permitting processes for a different use case from the demo countries use cases. The purpose of these examples is to showcase how AEC3PO can be applied to real-world scenarios and adapted to specific regulatory contexts. The folder contains sub-folders with the name of the demo countries. Each sub-folder contains the turtle file and related documentation. Every example is documented in the corresponding `readme file`. 

The following table represents a summary of the use cases:
