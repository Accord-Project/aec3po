<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The Architecture, Engineering, Construction, Compliance Checking and Permitting Ontology (AEC3PO) is an ontology developed in the context of the Automated Compliance Checks for Construction, Renovation or Demolition Works (ACCORD) project, which is a Horizon European project that aims to digitalise permitting and compliance processes. AEC3PO has been developed in order to capture all aspects of building compliance and building permitting in Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC). It allows the modelling of aspects such as:
<ul>
  <li>building codes, regulations, and standards</li>
  <li>compliance and permitting processes and documentation</li>
  <li>compliance and permitting actors</li>
</ul>
The ontology requirements are essentially derived from the rule formalisation methodology that aims to semantise regulations and provide an open format for machine-readable rules.

The ontology is built using Semantic Web technologies, adhering to standards like RDF, OWL, and SKOS. It makes use of well-known ontologies like Dublin Core Terms (DCT), Europe's Legislation Identifier (ELI), and more to create a structured and interconnected knowledge graph. This allows professionals to explore, query, and understand various aspects of the compliance and permitting processes more comprehensively.</p>
