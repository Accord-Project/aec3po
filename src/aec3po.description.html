<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The Architecture, Engineering, Construction, Compliance Checking and Permitting Ontology (AEC3PO) is an ontology developed to support the automated compliance checking of construction, renovation, and demolition works. It has been developed in the context of the Automated Compliance Checking for Construction, Renovation or Demolition Works (ACCORD) project, an ERC/Horizon-funded project that aims to digitalise permitting and compliance processes.</p>
<p>AEC3PO aims to capture all aspects of building compliance and building permitting in Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC), across different regulatory systems. It allows the modelling of aspects such as:
<ul>
  <li>building and infrastructure codes, regulations, and standards, and their compliance requirements</li>
  <li>building and infrastructure permitting processes and documentation</li>
  <li>building and infrastructure compliance and permitting actors</li>
</ul>
The ontology requirements are derived from the rule formalisation methodology that aims to semantise regulations and provide an open format for machine-readable rules.

The ontology is built using Semantic Web technologies, adhering to standards like RDF, OWL, and SKOS. It also integrates popular ontologies such as Dublin Core Terms (DCT) and
Europe's Legislation Identifier (ELI) in order to create a structured and interconnected knowledge graph. 
This allows professionals to explore, query, and understand various aspects of the compliance and permitting processes more comprehensively.</p>
