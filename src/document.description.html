<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The AEC3PO Document module describes building-compliance related documents, their subdivisions, down to individual statements.<p>

<p>Document subdivisions can be described as literals, link to their first part, and to their immediate following subdivision. This enables roundtripping from a document to its AEC3PO description, and back.</p>
