# AEC3PO: Architecture Engineering and Construction Compliance Checking and Permitting Ontology #

## Introduction ##
## Ontology Requirements ##
### As defined in the proposal: 
T2.2  Development  of  the  Building  Compliance  Ontology (BCU,VTT,  CU,  FRA,  ONTO,  SOL,  FUI,  IMT, FUNITEC, JU)[M8-M16]: Drawing on literature, expert interviews, T2.1 and WP1, develop a conceptual ontological model of building compliance requirements,  including laws,  regulations, processes,  and  documentation. This Building Compliance Ontology (BCO) is open-ended, and not tied to specific regional or legal systems.It is aligned  and  compatible  with  established  standardontologies  for  representing  both  generic  concepts  (time,  pro-cesses, files/document metadata)and the building domain specifically (building topology, construction projects). Specific laws, regulations, processes, and documentation will be implementations of this generic model. (D2.2)
### Requirements from T2.3 Machine-executable Regulations 
- Represent: a Document and Document Metadata.
- Represent: Sections, Subsections, Paragraphs, Subparagraphs, Lists, list items etc….
- Represent Cross referencing (inside and outside a document).
- Represent Tables, Figures, Equations and Captions of these.
- Identify a part of the document as containing rules, definitions or informative text.
- Identify individual rules –uniquely identify them in some way.
- Identify groups of rules.
- Allow the specification of the logic to relate rules and groups of rules together.
