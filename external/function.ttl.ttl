A function can have input parameters, output, solve certain problems, and can be implemented using certain algorithms. It's execution can also be described in an implementation-independent manner.

rdfs:comment """An algorithm is a specified set of instructions, independent of its implementation. A function can be implemented using a known algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm),
or use a combination of multiple algorithms to solve a certain problem. A function does not have to be implemented by any algorithm or have to be mapped one-on-one to an algorithm.
It is not required to have a one-to-one mapping between an algorithm and a problem."""@en .
